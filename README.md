just adding text
adding more info to the README.md.
I think the thing I struggled most with is interpretting instruction.
I just need to learn how to understand things better. I also was surprised with an issue with merging.
I believe I solved the issue wtih merging by doing git add in the terminal and committing my changes. It then merged with no issue.

I feel pretty confident in this. I might stumble a little bit, but I figured it out. I really tried to only 
ask for help when I had already tried at least 3 things on my own to see if I could figure it out on my own.I also asked for basically confirmation that I had done things correctly.
